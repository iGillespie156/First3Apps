<h1>What is this repository?</h1>
These were the first four apps I worked on. They should have been
in different repos - but I never split them up.

<h3>The To-Do App</h3>
This is an app that a user can run to handle their to do list. It has 
three main components. The ability to add todos, edit todos, and complete todos.

Modules used:

<H3>Convert Meters</H3>
This app allows the user to enter feet and inches. The app then converts
meters and provides the result.

Modules used:

<H3>File compressor</H3>
This app takes a number of files and the generates a zip file of them.

Modules used:

<H3>File Uncompressor</H3>

This app does the opposite of the previous one. It takes a zip file and uncompresses
it.
